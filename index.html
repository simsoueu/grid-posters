                    I created this page to test some things, I was initially interested in studying CSS-grid, and after
                    that I also decided to put what I learned in a page and to do so I would need to use some markup
                    and javascript to hold the stylesheet that I created. So after learning the basics of CSS-grid I
                    also try to use the advices given by some experts in javascript. Basically the code is small but I
                    think it is well organized, by 'organized' I mean the the view is not embedded with the control and
                    the separation of concerns is very clear in this code. At least that was my intention.

                    The figure below is dinnamically generated. The others are stored in the
                    javascript file.

                    This page was built using grid-css, a 3x1 more precisely, by '3x1' I mean 'three rows and
                    one column', the rows are: 1)
                    header, 2) body and 3) footer. The header itself is composed of another grid, this internal
                    grid is
                </div>

                <div class="grid-container">
                    <div class="child">
                        <div id="rand-poster"
                            class="poster-container">

                I created this page to test some things, its pretty basic, but the architecture is well
                made, I guess. The figure below is dinnamically generated. The others are stored in the
                javascript file.
